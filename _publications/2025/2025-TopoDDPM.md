# We propose TopoDDPM, a novel topological diffusion model that integrates topological features as shape-informed latent variables. We further introduce a topological loss function to enhance the model's sensitivity to topological variations, encouraging the generation of shapes with more consistent and meaningful topology. Despite having 160Ã— fewer parameters than LION, TopoDDPM achieves superior generation quality and faster inference speed.
