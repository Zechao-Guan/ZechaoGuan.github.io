  Attend a project on multimodal fusion for localization, planning, and 3D point cloud recognition in unmanned systems. Designed deep learning models to classify and segment 3D point clouds captured by depth cameras, focusing on distinguishing grass from obstacles. Proposed a universal topological layer (TopoLayer) based on persistent homology, and integrated it into mainstream architectures like PointMLP and PointNet++ to enhance recognition accuracy [<a href="https://github.com/Zechao-Guan/zechao-guan.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/covers/SchoolProject.mp4PNG" target="_blank">VIDEO</a>].
